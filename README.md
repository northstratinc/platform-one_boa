## Northstrat Mobile App Cloud Formation Template

Northstrat has created a mobile app that is one of multiple
internal corporate communications channels (including email, Microsoft
Teams, etc.).

The mobile app development team leveraged AWS CloudFormation, an 
AWS-specific Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool for creating and 
deploying AWS resources.

Northstrat created CloudFormation templates for creating all AWS
resources for the two isolated mobile app environments: test and
production.
