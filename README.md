## Northstrat Mobile App Cloud Formation Template

Northstrat uses a mobile app as one channel for internal corporate 
communications.

CloudFormation is an AWS-specific Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool 
that can be used to create and deploy AWS resources.

Northstrat created CloudFormation templates for creating all AWS
resources for two isolated AWS environments used for the app 
development: test, and production.
